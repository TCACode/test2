		            "Dominate the Day" Coach Maddox came up with this saying. He says that it makes him strive to be a better coach. He says he tells his players this constantly to remind them not only to dominate on the field, but to dominate whatever they are doing that day.

				Advice from the Coach
			</h2>
			<p>
                 Coach Maddox's advice was to never give up. He said that alot of coaches say that but he has a different meaning behind it. Coach Maddox says that growing up he was constantly told this, but he didnt get the meaning of it until later in his life. Never giving up is a symbol to the coach. He was tought that applied to the baseball field. Later he relized that the advice he was given wasn't just for the field. It was also meant for his walk with christ and relationships. He learned that he shouldn't give up on friends, family, or on the field.
